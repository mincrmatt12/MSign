Uses DMA to the GPIO to drive R0-B1 as well as the clock.
DMA is triggered off of TIM1 update event; the delay between different bits of color in PCM encoding goes off of TIM9.

## Protocol

The protocol starts with a handshake, initiated from the STM32, and continues asynchronously.

### Command format

```
| 0xA6 | 0x00 | 0x11 | <payload> |
  |       |     |
  |       |     ------ command, see below
  |       ---- payload size
  --- direction byte, A6 for packets from the esp, A5 for packets from the STM
```

| Name | Byte |
| ---- | ---- |
| `HANDSHAKE_INIT` | `0x10` |
| `HANDSHAKE_RESP` | `0x11` |
| `HANDSHAKE_OK` | `0x12` |
| `HANDSHAKE_UOK` | `0x13` |
| `RESET` | `0x50` |
| `PING` | `0x51` |
| `PONG` | `0x52` |
| `UPDATE_CMD` | `0x60` |
| `UPDATE_IMG_DATA` | `0x61` |
| `UPDATE_IMG_START` | `0x62` |
| `UPDATE_STATUS` | `0x63` |
| `CONSOLE_MSG` | `0x70` |


### Handshake

STM sends command `HANDSHAKE_INIT`, esp responds with `HANDSHAKE_RESP`, STM finishes with `HANDSHAKE_OK`. All handshake commands have payload size 0 and no payload.
The command `HANDSHAKE_UOK` is sent to indicate that the STM should enter update mode.

### Consoles

A console is a unidirectional stream of characters. There are three consoles on the MSign:

| ID | Usage |
| --- | ---------|
| `0x01` | The debug console input; as accessed through the web interface for commands starting with `"stm"` |
| `0x02` | The debug console output; relayed back to the web interface, hooked to `stderr` |
| `0x10` | `printf` output; logs, hooked to `stdout` |

The protocol uses one message for these:

```
| 0x01 | <data> |
  |      |
  |		 - character data for the remainder of the message
  -------- the console ID
```

It can be sent from either device.

### Other commands

When either device sends the `RESET` command, both devices should reset. Usually sent by the ESP upon grabbing new configuration -- but the STM can also send it in rare cases.

When either device sends the `PING` command, the other MUST respond with the `PONG` command, UNLESS the handshake has not been completed.

The above three commands have no payload.

### Update commands

The update procedure is rather complicated due to the requirement to update two things.
The first step is the ESP receiving an update package. While it is downloading the package, it updates various status slots to inform. Once it has finished, it will send a `RESET` command to reset the device.
When the system reboots, the ESP shall respond with `HANDSHAKE_UOK` on successful handshaking. Once this occurs, the STM enter update mode. Once the update finishes for the STM, it must send an appropriate `UPDATE_STATUS` to the ESP. Once this occurs,
the ESP will update itself. When it finishes, the STM will hear a `UPDATE_CMD` to reset itself to normal mode. At this point, the system is updated.

#### Detailed flow

After the `RESET`, the ESP will send various `UPDATE_CMD`s, and then the image.

The `UPDATE_CMD` message looks like this:

```
| 0xFF |
 |
 ---- cmd ID
```

where `cmd ID` is:

| ID | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `0x10` | Cancel update mode / reset to normal mode |
| `0x11` | Prepare to recieve image
| `0x30` | Image read error |
| `0x31` | Image checksum error |
| `0x32` | Invalid state error |
| `0x40` | Update completed successfully |
| `0x50` | ESP wrote sector (see below) |
| `0x51` | ESP copying sector (see below) |

Once message `0x11` is sent, the STM should get ready to recieve the `UPDATE_IMG_START`. This message contains:

The STM can respond with `UPDATE_STATUS` messages, with the same format.

| ID | Meaning |
| :--- | ------ |
| `0x10` | Entered update mode |
| `0x12` | Ready for image |
| `0x13` | Ready for chunk |
| `0x20` | Beginning copy process |
| `0x21` | Copy process completed |
| `0x30` | Resend last chunk, csum error |
| `0x40` | Checksum error on entire thing, abort procedure |

Note there are no errors for copy process as if it fails the code won't run. If the ESP doesn't get anything for a few minutes it can report failure and ask for manual reflashing.

```
| 0xCC CC | 0xSS SS SS SS | 0xCNCN |
  |          |               |
  |          |               ------ chunck count, little endian 16bits
  |          ---- size of new image, bytes, little endian 32bits
  ---- checksum, little endian 16bits, CRC16
```

Then, the STM can send `UPDATE_STATUS` commands to get the chunks.

Once it sends the `0x13` message, the ESP responds with a chunk like this:

```
| 0xCC 0xCC | <data for rest of message>
  |            |
  |            -- chunk data (size = msgsize - 2) extra bytes are padded with zeros
  ---- CRC-16 checksum for this chunk
```

After each chunk, the STM can respond with an error or a new message.
If the stm deduces it has received all chunks, it sends the finished message and updates itself.
After completion of this process, it sends the status corresponding to update completed.
The ESP will then begin writing the image to itself in preparation for copying, and will send out "ESP wrote sector" messages
as it does so.
The STM then waits for the ESP to send a cmd corresponding to completed.
It then resets.
